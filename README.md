üíª ## Analyses

1. **Comparison of Daily Advertising Expenses and DNU Graph**: Daily advertising expenses are visualized and compared with the DNU (Daily New Users) graph.

2. **Cohort Retention Analysis**: D1, D3, D7, and D14 retention is calculated for all dates in the dataset. The results are interpreted.

3. **ARPPU Trend Analysis**: ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User) is calculated for all dates, and its trend is interpreted. Additionally, a comparison of ARPPU between the US and PH countries is made.

4. **ROAS Analysis**: ROAS (Return on Advertising Spend) is calculated for D1, D3, D7, and D14 and interpreted.

5. **Spenders Analysis**: The number of first-time and repeat spenders within DAU for all dates is found.

6. **Most Challenging Stage Analysis**: The stage where players face the most challenges is predicted and interpreted.

7. **Player Behavior Analysis**: Special SQL queries are used to examine the behavior of a specific player profile.
